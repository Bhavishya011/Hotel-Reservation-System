# Hotel Reservation System 

A simple command-line based **Hotel Reservation System** built in Java using **JDBC** to connect to a MySQL database. This project allows hotel staff to manage room reservations by providing an interactive text-based interface.

---

##  Features

-  Reserve a room
-  View all current reservations
-  Placeholder for search functionality
-  Update a reservation
-  Delete a reservation
-  Exit the system with a graceful message

---

##  Exception Handling

This project is built with **full exception handling** to ensure robust behavior even during unexpected inputs or system issues.

###  Handled Scenarios

| Exception | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ClassNotFoundException` | Thrown when the MySQL JDBC driver is not found. |
| `SQLException` | Catches all DB-related issues: connection failure, invalid query, etc. |
| `InputMismatchException` | Prevents crashes when users enter non-numeric input for numeric fields. |
| `InterruptedException` | Handles system exit animation delays. |
| `RuntimeException` | Safeguards against uncaught input or logic errors during runtime. |

###  Defensive Programming Measures

- Scanner `.nextLine()` calls used smartly to **consume newlines** after `.nextInt()` inputs.
- Input validation using `hasNextInt()` (in earlier versions).
- Structured try-catch blocks around **every DB call** and risky input area.
- Graceful fallback messages such as `"Insertion Failed"` or `"Invalid Choice"` instead of abrupt crashes.

| guest_name       | VARCHAR(100)  | Full name of the guest               |
| contact_number   | INT           | Guest‚Äôs contact number               |
| room_number      | INT           | Room number being reserved           |
| reservation_date | TIMESTAMP     | Automatically generated on insert    |

###  SQL Setup

```sql
CREATE DATABASE hotel_db;

USE hotel_db;

CREATE TABLE reservations (
  reservation_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  guest_name VARCHAR(100),
  contact_number INT,
  room_number INT,
  reservation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
